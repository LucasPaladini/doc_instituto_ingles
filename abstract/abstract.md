## Abstract

The software to be addressed, called **SIFA (Software Intuitivo de Fácil Aplicación)**, is designed to respond to the specific needs of an educational institution with a structure reduced to an English institute located in the town of Roldán. The development of SIFA focuses on offering a solution that allows the efficient management of student information, the administration of courses and the control of payments. The proposal includes functionalities ranging from the registration and enrollment of students to the management of attendance and payments, all with an intuitive interface that minimizes the learning process for users.

Currently, the institute manages student data, attendance and payments through manual methods, such as paper forms. The SIFA software aims to transform these processes into digital ones, allowing for more organized and efficient management.
